# **💣 Password-Protected Self-Destructing Message**

### **⚠️ Enter at your own risk! ⚠️**

Welcome to the **world of secrets** and **hacking magic**. This project lets you send secret messages with an ultra-cool twist: **Self-Destructing messages** that vanish after 10 seconds!

**But wait!** There’s a catch — only those with the **correct password** will be granted access. Otherwise, you'll trigger a **"Memory Dump"** that causes your screen to glitch like a computer under attack! 😱

## **💡 What is this?**

This is a **Password-Protected Self-Destructing Message System** written in C. It has the following features:

1. **Password Protection**: Only authorized users can view the secret message.
2. **Fake Crash Effect**: Wrong passwords will cause your screen to glitch out with random characters, just like the system is failing.
3. **Self-Destructing Message**: The secret message will **disappear** in 10 seconds — leaving no trace behind. 🔥

## **💻 How It Works:**

1. **Enter the Password**: When you run the program, you’ll be asked to enter a password.
2. **Correct Password?**: If the password is correct, the secret message is revealed, and it begins the **countdown** to destruction.
3. **Wrong Password?**: If the password is wrong, the program triggers an **epic glitch** where it floods your screen with random symbols. No one will dare try again! 😎
4. **Message Self-Destructs**: After 10 seconds, the secret message **disappears**, and the system shows a **message destroyed** notification. 💥
